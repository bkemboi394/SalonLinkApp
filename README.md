# SalonLink-Java Application
This was a class project for my Software Architecture and Design class at SMU that I am continuing to explore and build upon.

Currently, this SalonLink application simplifies the discovery, selection, and booking of salon services, allowing users to browse nearby salons, pick services, and make bookings using a user-friendly interface. 

I am in the process of:

1. Getting the application to also allow salon owners to effectively manage the information about their salon.â€‹
2. Improving both the front-end and back-end parts of the application through additional features, etc. to improve its functionality and usability.
